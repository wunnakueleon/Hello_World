"""
First, create three turtles: snatching turtle, guarding turtle and canon-shooting turtle
- Snatching turtle will be snatching the food, (obviously)
If the snatcher gets the fruit, it's GAME OVER.
- Guarding turtle will guard the fruit from being snatched
If the guard grasps the snatcher, it's GAME OVER.
- Canon-shooting turtle will shoot canon at the press of a button.
If the snatcher gets the shooting turtle, the snatcher will double in size and speed.
That turtle will assist the guard. And the cannons will be bouncing across the screen once it was shot.
But the catch is that, that if any cannon hits the fruit, it's GAME OVER.
"""

# set up a screen

# Create fruit
"""
Since we will be determining the position of the guard based on the fruit, we need to build this ahead of the guard.
"""

# display all the turtles and the fruit on screen

"""
Limit the frame for all the things inside from being escaped. Eg. turtles, cannons.
